# Minesweeper Game Frontend

Frontend for the classic game of Minesweeper in VueJS

## Prerequisites

Be sure that you have installed [Node JS 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or later.

## Getting stared
+ Configure the **API endpoint** (If you want to run it locally) => `api.root`: to do that you need to open `/src/config/index.js` and set your own configuration.
  ```
  api: {
    root: '[YOUR_API_ENDPOINT_HERE]'
  }
  ```

## Build Setup
Be sure that you are in `/frontend/minesweeper` folder.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
